# Genesis

Overview:
This 3D puzzle game takes place in the year 2084, centering in on Project Genesis, a space colonization mission divined by NASA 
and JAXA. With recent breakthroughs in microbiology just before The Great War, bacteria can now be used to perfectly identify 
entire genomes in seconds. While that research was being done, partnered laboratories explored the harmful side of genetics - 
diseases, chromosome issues, disorders, and conditions. Over time, the partnered labs gathered enough data to extract the 
exact genes that caused any genetic issue. Paired with the breakthrough of quickly mapping entire genomes, any genetic issue 
could be cured. By creating genetically engineered humans with this ability, cells throughout the body can identify, replicate, 
and nurture healthy cells and kill any deviating cell for an undetermined amount of time. Humans can no longer die of natural causes. 

The procedure to engineer a human with this trait was risky and incredibly expensive - which is why there were only two created.
Especially due to the worldwide economic collapse that ended the Great War, there weren't many resources available.
These two humans, aptly named Adam and Eve, were babies when they were sent into space with Project Genesis. 

The project was created to take advantage of the lifespan of the new humans and colonize a planet that could support life 
discovered in 2074. In fact, the project was first created when space agencies realized the implications of an extended human 
life. When the paper on Genome Sequencing Through Bacteria was published in 2075, the year after finding the inhabitable 
planet Terranovus, space agencies banded together to begin colonizing this new planet. This is Adam and Eve's story.
